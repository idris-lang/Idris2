%default covering

-- This file contains support for building a guess at the term on the LHS of an
-- 'impossible' case, in order to help build a tree of covered cases for
-- coverage checking. Since the LHS by definition won't be well typed, we are
-- only guessing! But we can still do some type-directed disambiguation of
-- names.
-- Constants (fromInteger/fromString etc) won't be supported, because in general
-- they involve resoling interfaces - they'll just become unmatchable patterns.
