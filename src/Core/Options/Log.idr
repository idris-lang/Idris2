%default total

||| Log levels are characterised by two things:
||| * a dot-separated path of ever finer topics of interest e.g. scope.let
||| * a natural number corresponding to the verbosity level e.g. 5
|||
||| If the user asks for some logs by writing
|||
|||     %log scope 5
|||
||| they will get all of the logs whose path starts with `scope` and whose
||| verbosity level is less or equal to `5`. By combining different logging
||| directives, users can request information about everything (with a low
||| level of details) and at the same time focus on a particular subsystem
||| they want to get a lot of information about. For instance:
|||
|||     %log 1
|||     %log scope.let 10
|||
||| will deliver basic information about the various phases the compiler goes
||| through and deliver a lot of information about scope-checking let binders.
