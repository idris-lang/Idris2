  ||| Type representing the syntax tree of an Idris 2 program after lambda
  ||| lifting.
  |||
  ||| All constructors take as argument a file context, describing the position
  ||| of the original code pre-transformation.
  |||
  ||| @ vars is the list of names accessible within the current scope of the
  |||   lambda-lifted code.
  public export
  data Lifted : (vars : List Name) -> Type where

       ||| A local variable in the lambda-lifted syntax tree.
       |||
       ||| @ idx is the index that the variable can be found at in the syntax
       |||   tree's current scope.
       ||| @ p is evidence that indexing into vars with idx will provide the
       |||   correct variable.
       LLocal : {idx : Nat} -> FC -> (0 p : IsVar x idx vars) -> Lifted vars

       ||| A known function applied to exactly the right number of arguments.
       |||
       ||| Back-end runtimes should be able to utilise total applications
       ||| effectively, and so they are given a specific constructor here.
       |||
       ||| @ lazy is used to signify that this function application is lazy,
       |||   and, if so, the reason for lazy application.
       ||| @ n is the name of the function to be invoked.
       ||| @ args is the list of arguments for the function call.
       LAppName : FC -> (lazy : Maybe LazyReason) -> (n : Name) ->
                  (args : List (Lifted vars)) -> Lifted vars

       ||| A known function applied to fewer arguments than its arity.
       |||
       ||| Situations described by this constructor will likely be handled by
       ||| by runtimes by creating a closure which waits for the remaining
       ||| arguments.
       |||
       ||| @ n is the name of the function to be (eventually) invoked.
       ||| @ missing is the number of arguments missing from this application.
       ||| @ args is a list of the arguments known at this point in time.
       LUnderApp : FC -> (n : Name) -> (missing : Nat) ->
                   (args : List (Lifted vars)) -> Lifted vars

       ||| A closure applied to one more argument.
       |||
       ||| This given argument may be the last one that the closure is waiting
       ||| on before being able to run; runtimes should check for such a
       ||| situation, and run the function if it is now fully applied.
       |||
       ||| @ lazy is used to signify that this function application is lazy,
       |||   and, if so, the reason for lazy application.
       ||| @ closure is the closure being applied.
       ||| @ arg is the extra argument being given to the closure.
       LApp : FC -> (lazy : Maybe LazyReason) -> (closure : Lifted vars) ->
              (arg : Lifted vars) -> Lifted vars

       ||| A let binding: binding a new name to an existing expression.
       |||
       ||| Roughly, this constructor represents code of the form:
       ||| ```idris
       ||| let
       |||   x = expr
       ||| in
       |||   body
       ||| ```
       |||
       ||| @ x is the new name to bind.
       ||| @ expr is the expression to bind `x` to.
       ||| @ body is the expression to evaluate after binding.
       LLet : FC -> (x : Name) -> (expr : Lifted vars) ->
              (body : Lifted (x :: vars)) -> Lifted vars

       ||| Use of a constructor to construct a compound data type value.
       |||
       ||| @ n is the name of the data type.
       ||| @ info is information about the constructor.
       ||| @ tag is the tag value for the construction, if the type is an
       |||   algebraic data type.
       ||| @ args is the list of arguments for the constructor.
       LCon : FC -> (n : Name) -> (info : ConInfo) -> (tag : Maybe Int) ->
              (args : List (Lifted vars)) -> Lifted vars

       ||| An operator applied to operands.
       |||
       ||| @ arity is the arity of the operator.
       ||| @ lazy is used to signify that this operation is lazy, and, if so,
       |||   the reason for lazy application.
       ||| @ op is the operator being used.
       ||| @ args is a vector containing the operands of the operation.
       LOp : {arity : _} ->
             FC -> (lazy : Maybe LazyReason) -> (op : PrimFn arity) ->
             (args : Vect arity (Lifted vars)) -> Lifted vars

       ||| A second, more involved, form of primitive operation, defined using
       ||| `%extern` pragmas.
       |||
       ||| Backends should cause a compile-time error when encountering an
       ||| unimplemented LExtPrim operation.
       |||
       ||| @ lazy is used to signify that this operation is lazt, and, if so,
       |||   the reason for lazy application.
       ||| @ p is the name of the operator being used.
       ||| @ args is a list of operands for the operation.
       LExtPrim : FC -> (lazy : Maybe LazyReason) -> (p : Name) ->
                  (args : List (Lifted vars)) -> Lifted vars

       ||| A case split on constructor tags.
       |||
       ||| @ expr is the value to match against.
       ||| @ alts is a list of the different branches in the case statement.
       ||| @ def is an (optional) default branch, taken if no branch in alts is
       |||   taken.
       LConCase : FC -> (expr : Lifted vars) ->
                  (alts : List (LiftedConAlt vars)) ->
                  (def : Maybe (Lifted vars)) -> Lifted vars

       ||| A case split on a constant expression.
       |||
       ||| @ expr is the expression to match against.
       ||| @ alts is a list of the different branches in the case statement.
       ||| @ def is an (optional) default branch, taken if no branch in alts is
       |||   taken.
       LConstCase : FC -> (expr : Lifted vars) ->
                    (alts : List (LiftedConstAlt vars)) ->
                    (def : Maybe (Lifted vars)) -> Lifted vars

       ||| A primitive (constant) value.
       LPrimVal : FC -> Constant -> Lifted vars

       ||| An erased value.
       LErased : FC -> Lifted vars

       ||| A forceful crash of the program.
       |||
       ||| This kind of crash is generated by the Idris 2 compiler; it is
       ||| separate from crashes explicitly added to code by programmers (for
       ||| example via `idris_crash`).
       |||
       ||| @ msg is a message emitted when crashing that might be useful for
       |||   debugging.
       LCrash : FC -> (msg : String) -> Lifted vars

  ||| A branch of an "LCon" (constructor tag) case statement.
  |||
  ||| @ vars is the list of names accessible within the current scope of the
  |||   lambda-lifted code.
  public export
  data LiftedConAlt : (vars : List Name) -> Type where

       ||| Constructs a branch of an "LCon" (constructor tag) case statement.
       |||
       ||| If this branch is taken, members of the compound data value being
       ||| inspected are bound to new names before evaluation continues.
       |||
       ||| @ n is the name of the constructor that this branch checks for.
       ||| @ info is information about the constructor.
       ||| @ tag is a tag value, present if the type of the value
       |||   inspected is an algebraic data type (this can be matched against
       |||   instead of the constructor's name, if preferable).
       ||| @ args is a list of new names that are bound to the inspected value's
       |||   members before evaluation of this branch's body (this is similar
       |||   to using a let binding for each member of the value).
       ||| @ body is the expression that is evaluated as the consequence of
       |||   this branch matching.
       MkLConAlt : (n : Name) -> (info : ConInfo) -> (tag : Maybe Int) ->
                   (args : List Name) -> (body : Lifted (args ++ vars)) ->

  public export

       ||| Constructs a branch of an "LConst" (constant expression) case
       ||| statement.
       |||
       ||| @ expr is the constant expression to match against.
       ||| @ body is the expression that is evaluated as the consequence of this
       |||   branch matching.
       MkLConstAlt : (expr : Constant) -> (body : Lifted vars) ->
                     LiftedConstAlt vars

||| Top-level definitions in the lambda-lifted intermediate representation of an
||| Idris 2 program.
public export
data LiftedDef : Type where

     ||| Constructs a function definition.
     |||
     ||| @ args is the arguments accepted by the function.
     ||| @ scope is the list of names accessible within the current scope of the
     |||   lambda-lifted code.
     ||| @ body is the body of the function.
     -- We take the outer scope and the function arguments separately so that
     -- we don't have to reshuffle de Bruijn indices, which is expensive.
     -- This should be compiled as a function which takes 'args' first,
     -- then 'reverse scope'.
     -- (Sorry for the awkward API - it's to do with how the indices are
     -- arranged for the variables, and it could be expensive to reshuffle them!
     -- See Compiler.ANF for an example of how they get resolved to names)
     MkLFun : (args : List Name) -> (scope : List Name) ->
              (body : Lifted (scope ++ args)) -> LiftedDef

     ||| Constructs a definition of a constructor for a compound data type.
     |||
     ||| @ tag is a tag value used by the constructor (if present) to keep track
     |||   of the value's type when using algebraic data types.
     ||| @ arity is the arity of the constructor; the number of arguments it
     |||   takes.
     ||| @ nt is information related to newtype unboxing; backend
     |||   implementations needs not make use of this argument, as newtype
     |||   unboxing is managed by the Idris 2 compiler.
     MkLCon : (tag : Maybe Int) -> (arity : Nat) -> (nt : Maybe Nat) ->
              LiftedDef

     ||| Constructs a forward declaration of a foreign function.
     |||
     ||| @ ccs is a list of calling conventions; these are annotations to
     |||   foreign functions, used by backends to relate foreign function calls
     |||   correctly.
     ||| @ fargs is a list of the types of the arguments to the function.
     ||| @ ret is the type of the return value of the function.

     ||| Constructs an error condition.
     |||
     ||| The function produced by this construction should accept any number of
     ||| arguments, and should crash at runtime. Such crashes should crash via
