||| This module provides a simple common subexpression elimination (CSE)
||| algorithm. The main goal right now is to move duplicate
||| expressions introduced during autosearch (which includes
||| interface resolution) to the top level.
|||
||| As such, the functionality provided by this module should
||| be considered a form of whole program optimization.
||| To keep things simple, it operates only on closed terms right
||| now, which are - in case of several occurences - introduced
||| as new zero-argument toplevel functions.
|||
||| The procedure is very simple: In an analysis step, we
||| iterate over all toplevel definitions once, trying to
||| convert every subexpression to a closed one (no free
||| variables). Closed terms are then stored in a `SortedMap`
||| together with their size and count. In order to only use
||| linear space w.r.t. term size, we start this analysis at the
||| leaves and substitute closed terms with the machine generated
||| names before analyzing parent terms.
|||
||| In a second step, we compare the count of each machine
||| generated name with the count of its parent expression.
||| If they are the same, the name is dropped and replaces with
||| a CSE optimized version of the original expression, otherwise
||| the name is kept and a new zero argumet function of the
||| given name is added to the toplevel, thus eliminating the
||| duplicate expressions.
