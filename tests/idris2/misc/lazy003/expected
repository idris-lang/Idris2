Main> Main.f1
Arguments []
Compile time tree: Delay (\x => x)
Compiled: Delay Lazy (\x=> x)
Refers to: Builtin.Unit
Flags: covering
Main> Main.f6
Arguments []
Compile time tree: Delay (\u1, {u2:839} => u1)
Compiled: Delay Lazy (\u1=> \{u2:839}=> u1)

Flags: covering
Main> Main.switch3
Arguments [{arg:0}]
Compile time tree: let f = Force (switch {arg:0}) in \{lamc:0} => let (x, (y, z)) = {lamc:0} in (f x, (f y, f z))
Detaggable arg types: [1]
Compiled: \ {arg:0} => let f = Force Lazy (Main.switch {arg:0}) in
\{lamc:0}=> case {lamc:0} of
  { Builtin.MkPair {tag = 0} [cons] {e:2} {e:3} => case {e:3} of  { Builtin.MkPair {tag = 0} [cons] {e:6} {e:7} => Builtin.MkPair {tag = 0} [cons] (f {e:2}) (Builtin.MkPair {tag = 0} [cons] (f {e:6}) (f {e:7}))}
  }
