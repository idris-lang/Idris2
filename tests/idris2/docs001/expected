Main> Prelude.Nat : Type
  Natural numbers: unbounded, unsigned integers which can be pattern matched.
  Totality: total
  Constructors:
    Z : Nat
      Zero.
    S : Nat -> Nat
      Successor.
Main> Prelude.List : Type -> Type
  Generic lists.

  Constructors:
    Nil : List a
      Empty list
    :: : a -> List a -> List a
Main> Prelude.Show : Type -> Type
  Things that have a canonical `String` representation.
  Parameters: ty
  Methods:
    show : (x : ty) -> String
      Convert a value to its `String` representation.
      @ x the value to convert
    showPrec : (d : Prec) -> (x : ty) -> String
      Convert a value to its `String` representation in a certain precedence
      context.
      
      A value should produce parentheses around itself if and only if the given
      precedence context is greater than or equal to the precedence of the
      outermost operation represented in the produced `String`. *This is
      different from Haskell*, which requires it to be strictly greater. `Open`
      should thus always produce *no* outermost parens, `App` should always
      produce outermost parens except on atomic values and those that provide
      their own bracketing, like `Pair` and `List`.
      @ d the precedence context.
      @ x the value to convert
