# Top-level constants are lazily evaluated and strongly memoised.
# This is implemented by wrapping them to the function called `__lazy`.
# The only top-level function that should not be treated so is the expression for `main : IO ()`.
# In this test we check this.
--------------
# Running an example without any top-level constants...
# We expect no usages of `__lazy` to be present
Hello, world!

# Running an example with some top-level constant...
# We expect `__lazy` to be used on the RHS for the top-level constant called `topLevelConst`.
