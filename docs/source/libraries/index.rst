Where To Find Libraries
=======================

You can find a canonical source of Idris libraries on the wiki on github:
https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/wiki/Third-party-Libraries

Please feel free to contribute your own libraries there! Eventually, we aim to
have a package manager for managing libraries and dependencies. We do not yet
have an official one, but there are (at least) two in development:

* Inigo: https://github.com/idris-community/inigo
* sae: https://github.com/DoctorRyner/sae
