Further information about Idris programming, and programming with
dependent types in general, can be obtained from various sources:

*  `Type-Driven Development with Idris <https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris>`_
   by Edwin Brady, available from `Manning <https://www.manning.com>`_.

*  `The community Idris2 tutorial <https://idris-community.github.io/idris2-tutorial/>`_,
   originally written by Stefan Höck, now maintained by the community.

*  The Idris website (https://www.idris-lang.org/) has pointers to a broad range
   of resources.

*  By asking questions on the `discord server <https://discord.gg/UX68fDs2jc>`_,
   or `the mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/idris-lang>`_
   (the discord server is currently the most active place for interactive
   discussion).

*  The IRC channel ``#idris``, on
   `libera.chat <https://libera.chat/>`__.

*  The wiki (https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/wiki) has further
   user provided information, in particular:

   * https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/wiki/Resources

   * https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/wiki/Editor-Support

   * https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/wiki/Third-party-Libraries

*  Existing projects on the ``Idris Community`` web space:

*  The papers describing Idris2 [#Brady2021]_ and the older Idris1
   [#Brady2011]_ [#Brady2013]_.  There is a wider (non-exhaustive) list of
   papers involving Idris
