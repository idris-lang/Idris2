Prerequisites for Windows
=========================

MSYS2
-----

To build Idris 2 on Windows, a Unix-like environment is needed for
all the utilities used during the build. `MSYS2 <https://www.msys2.org>`_ provides that for us.

    1. Download the latest version of MSYS2.
    2. Run the installer. Don't install it under Program Files,
       as it needs to write files (the "unix" home directory lies
       under there, for example).
    3. In the directory where you installed MSYS2, find the file
       ``mingw64.ini`` and add the line ``MSYS2_PATH_TYPE=inherit``.
       This adds the normal windows PATH to the shell in MSYS2.
    4. Start MSYS2 (click on mingw64.exe, as the icon in the Start menu
       won't pick up the MSYS2_PATH_TYPE from the .ini file - it can
       be added to the system settings instead).
    5. Update the installation with the latest releases with
       ``pacman -Syu``.
    6. Install the programs that the build needs with::

            $ pacman -S make mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc


Chez Scheme
-----------

Chez Scheme has a ready-made installer at `GitHub <https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme/releases>`_.

    1. Download the installer and run it. Do not install it in a path with spaces - currently,
       Idris2 has trouble with them.
    2. Add the threaded 64-bit Scheme binary to the PATH. It is the
       ``\bin\ta6nt`` subdirectory where Chez Scheme was installed. So if you used "C:\Chez", it
       will be in ``C:\Chez\bin\ta6nt``.

Building
--------

1. Start a fresh MSYS2 shell so that it knows about your
   modified PATH (it's important to use Mingw64 to get
   access to the right compilers).
2. Navigate to the Idris2 directory.
3. Set the SCHEME environment variable that Idris2 needs
   ``export SCHEME=scheme``. This can be set permanently in the
   bash profile file or the Windows settings.
4. Now ``make bootstrap && make install`` should build Idris2 and
   install it in ``home/<username>/.idris2/bin`` under your MSYS2
   installation. If you add that to the PATH in Windows settings, it
   will be usable from any command line (including Powershell or DOS) that you open.
