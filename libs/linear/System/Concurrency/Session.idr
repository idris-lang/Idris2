||| A (bidirectional) channel is parametrised by a session it must respect.
|||
||| It is implemented in terms of two low-level channels: one for sending
||| and one for receiving. This ensures that we never are in a situation
||| where a thread with session (Send Nat (Recv String ...)) sends a natural
||| number and subsequently performs a receive before the other party
||| to the communication had time to grab the Nat thus receiving it
||| instead of a String.
|||
||| The low-level channels can only carry values of a single type. And so
||| they are given respective union types corresponding to the types that
||| can be sent on the one hand and the ones that can be received on the
||| other.
||| These union types are tagged unions where if `ty` is at index `k` in
||| the list of types `tys` then `(k, v)` is a value of `Union tys` provided
||| that `v` has type `ty`.
|||
||| `sendStep`, `recvStep`, `seePrefix`, and `seen` encode the fact that
||| we have already performed some of the protocol and so the low-level
||| channels' respective types necessarily mention types that we won't
||| see anymore.
