||| Concurrency primitives, e.g. threads, mutexes, etc.
|||
||| N.B.: At the moment this is pretty fundamentally tied to the Scheme RTS.
||| Given that different back ends will have entirely different threading

export

%foreign "scheme:blodwen-mutex-acquire"

||| Creates and returns a new mutex.
export
makeMutex : HasIO io => io Mutex
makeMutex = primIO prim__makeMutex

||| Acquires the mutex identified by `mutex`. The thread blocks until the mutex
||| has been acquired.
|||
||| Mutexes are recursive in Posix threads terminology, which means that the
||| calling thread can use mutex-acquire to (re)acquire a mutex it already has.
||| In this case, an equal number of mutex-release calls is necessary to release
||| the mutex.
export
mutexAcquire : HasIO io => Mutex -> io ()
mutexAcquire m = primIO (prim__mutexAcquire m)

||| Releases the mutex identified by `mutex`. Unpredictable behavior results if
||| the mutex is not owned by the calling thread.
export
mutexRelease : HasIO io => Mutex -> io ()
mutexRelease m = primIO (prim__mutexRelease m)


-- Condition variables

export

%foreign "scheme,racket:blodwen-cv-broadcast"
         "scheme,chez:blodwen-condition-broadcast"
prim__conditionBroadcast : Condition -> PrimIO ()


||| Creates and returns a new condition variable.
export
makeCondition : HasIO io => io Condition
makeCondition = primIO prim__makeCondition

||| Waits up to the specified timeout for the condition identified by the
||| condition variable `cond`. The calling thread must have acquired the mutex
||| identified by `mutex` at the time `conditionWait` is called. The mutex is
||| released as a side effect of the call to `conditionWait`. When a thread is
||| later released from the condition variable by one of the procedures
||| described below, the mutex is reacquired and `conditionWait` returns.
export
conditionWait : HasIO io => Condition -> Mutex -> io ()
conditionWait cond mutex = primIO (prim__conditionWait cond mutex)

||| Variant of `conditionWait` with a timeout in microseconds.
||| When the timeout expires, the thread is released, `mutex` is reacquired, and
||| `conditionWaitTimeout` returns.
export
conditionWaitTimeout : HasIO io => Condition -> Mutex -> Int -> io ()
conditionWaitTimeout cond mutex timeout = primIO (prim__conditionWaitTimeout cond mutex timeout)

||| Releases one of the threads waiting for the condition identified by `cond`.
export
conditionSignal : HasIO io => Condition -> io ()
conditionSignal c = primIO (prim__conditionSignal c)

||| Releases all of the threads waiting for the condition identified by `cond`.

%foreign "scheme:blodwen-semaphore-post"
prim__semaphorePost : Semaphore -> PrimIO ()
%foreign "scheme:blodwen-semaphore-wait"
prim__semaphoreWait : Semaphore -> PrimIO ()


||| Creates and returns a new semaphore with the counter initially set to `init`.
export
makeSemaphore : HasIO io => Int -> io Semaphore
makeSemaphore init = primIO (prim__makeSemaphore init)

||| Increments the semaphore's internal counter.
export
semaphorePost : HasIO io => Semaphore -> io ()
semaphorePost sema = primIO (prim__semaphorePost sema)

||| Blocks until the internal counter for semaphore sema is non-zero. When the
||| counter is non-zero, it is decremented and `semaphoreWait` returns.
export
semaphoreWait : HasIO io => Semaphore -> io ()
semaphoreWait sema = primIO (prim__semaphoreWait sema)


-- Barriers

||| A barrier enables multiple threads to synchronize the beginning of some
||| computation.
export
data Barrier : Type where [external]

%foreign "scheme:blodwen-make-barrier"
prim__makeBarrier : Int -> PrimIO Barrier
%foreign "scheme:blodwen-barrier-wait"

||| Creates a new barrier that can block a given number of threads.
|||
||| @ numThreads the number of threads to block
export
makeBarrier : HasIO io => (numThreads : Int) -> io Barrier
makeBarrier numThreads = primIO (prim__makeBarrier numThreads)

||| Blocks the current thread until all threads have rendezvoused here.
export

-- Channels

export

%foreign "scheme:blodwen-channel-get"
prim__channelGet : Channel a -> PrimIO a
%foreign "scheme:blodwen-channel-put"
prim__channelPut : Channel a -> a -> PrimIO ()

||| Creates and returns a new `Channel`.
|||
||| The channel can be used with `channelGet` to receive a value through the
||| channel.
||| The channel can be used with `channelPut` to send a value through the
||| channel.
export
makeChannel : HasIO io => io (Channel a)
makeChannel = primIO prim__makeChannel

||| Blocks until a sender is ready to provide a value through `chan`. The result
||| is the sent value.
|||
||| @ chan the channel to receive on
export
channelGet : HasIO io => (chan : Channel a) -> io a
channelGet chan = primIO (prim__channelGet chan)

||| Puts a value on the given channel.
|||
||| CAUTION: Different behaviour under chez and racket:
||| - Chez: Puts a value on the channel. If there already is a value, blocks
|||         until that value has been received.
||| - Racket: Blocks until a receiver is ready to accept the value `val` through
|||           `chan`.
|||
||| @ chan the `Channel` to send the value over
||| @ val  the value to send
export
channelPut : HasIO io => (chan : Channel a) -> (val : a) -> io ()
channelPut chan val = primIO (prim__channelPut chan val)
