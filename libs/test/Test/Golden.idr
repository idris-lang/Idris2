||| Core features required to perform Golden file testing.
|||
||| We provide the core functionality to run a *single* golden file test, or
||| a whole test tree.
||| This allows the developer freedom to use as is or design the rest of the
||| test harness to their liking.
|||
||| This was originally used as part of Idris2's own test suite and
||| the core functionality is useful for the many and not the few.
||| Please see Idris2 test harness for example usage.
|||
||| # Test Structure
|||
||| This harness works from the assumption that each individual golden test
||| comprises of a directory with the following structure:
|||
||| + `run` a *shell* script that runs the test. We expect it to:
|||   * Use `$1` as the variable standing for the idris executable to be tested
|||   * May use `${IDRIS2_TESTS_CG}` to pick a codegen that ought to work
|||   * Clean up after itself (e.g. by running `rm -rf build/`)
|||
||| + `expected` a file containting the expected output of `run`
|||
||| During testing, the test harness will generate an artefact named `output`
||| and display both outputs if there is a failure.
||| During an interactive session the following command is used to compare them
||| as they are:
|||
||| ```sh
|||  git diff --no-index --exit-code --word-diff-regex=. --color expected output
||| ```
|||
||| If `git` fails then the runner will simply present the expected and 'given'
||| files side-by-side.
|||
||| Of note, it is helpful to add `output` to a local `.gitignore` instance
||| to ensure that it is not mistakenly versioned.
|||
||| # Options
|||
||| The test harness has several options that may be set:
|||
||| + `idris2`       The path of the executable we are testing.
||| + `codegen`      The backend to use for code generation.
||| + `onlyNames`    The tests to run relative to the generated executable.
||| + `onlyFile`     The file listing the tests to run relative to the generated executable.
||| + `interactive`  Whether to offer to update the expected file or not.
||| + `timing`       Whether to display time taken for each test.
||| + `threads`      The maximum numbers to use (default: number of cores).
||| + `failureFile`  The file in which to write the list of failing tests.
|||
||| We provide an options parser (`options`) that takes the list of command line
||| arguments and constructs this for you.
|||
||| # Usage
|||
||| When compiled to an executable the expected usage is:
|||
|||```sh
||| runtests <path to executable under test>
|||   [--timing]
|||   [--interactive]
|||   [--only-file PATH]
|||   [--failure-file PATH]
|||   [--threads N]
|||   [--cg CODEGEN]
|||   [[--only|--except] [NAMES]]
|||```
|||
||| assuming that the test runner is compiled to an executable named `runtests`.
