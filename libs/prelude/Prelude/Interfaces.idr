-- FOLDABLE, TRAVERSABLE --

||| The `Foldable` interface describes how you can iterate over the elements in
||| a parameterised type and combine the elements together, using a provided
||| function, into a single result.

||| A minimal definition includes `foldr`
public export
interface Foldable t where
  constructor MkFoldable
  ||| Successively combine the elements in a parameterised type using the
  ||| provided function, starting with the element that is in the final position
  ||| i.e. the right-most position.
  ||| @ func  The function used to 'fold' an element into the accumulated result
  ||| @ init  The starting value the results are being combined into
  ||| @ input The parameterised type
  foldr : (func : elem -> acc -> acc) -> (init : acc) -> (input : t elem) -> acc

  ||| The same as `foldr` but begins the folding from the element at the initial
  ||| position in the data structure i.e. the left-most position.
  ||| @ func  The function used to 'fold' an element into the accumulated result
  ||| @ init  The starting value the results are being combined into
  ||| @ input The parameterised type
  foldl : (func : acc -> elem -> acc) -> (init : acc) -> (input : t elem) -> acc
  foldl f z t = foldr (flip (.) . flip f) id t z

  ||| Test whether the structure is empty.
  ||| @ acc The accumulator value which is specified to be lazy
  null : t elem -> Bool
  null xs = foldr {acc = Lazy Bool} (\ _,_ => False) True xs

  ||| Similar to `foldl`, but uses a function wrapping its result in a `Monad`.
  ||| Consequently, the final value is wrapped in the same `Monad`.
