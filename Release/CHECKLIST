    without the leading `v`, only the numbers. (N.B. This requires the new
    version tag to exist!)
- [ ] Update idris-lang website
  - [ ] Copy the `idris2-X.Y.Z.tgz` (created by `mkdist.sh`) to the website's
    `content/releases/` subdirectory.
  - [ ] Create a corresponding `idris2-X.Y.Z.tgz.sha256` in the website's
    `content/releases/` subdirectory, containing the output of `sha256sum` run
    with the tarball as its argument.
  - [ ] Create a brief post in the website's `content/posts/` subdirectory
    announcing the new release.
  - [ ] Update the website's `content/pages/download.rst` page, moving the now
    previous release to the list of historic releases, and updating the version
    numbers, links, and dates in the main text to match the new release.
- [ ] Update `IDRIS2_MINIMUM_COMPAT_VERSION` in
  `.github/workflows/ci-idris2-and-libs.yml` to point to the new release
  version.
- [ ] If not already pending, create a PR to against
  `idris2-pack-db/collections/HEAD.toml` so that it uses the latest release
  version.
- [ ] Clear the release checklist
