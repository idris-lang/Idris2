[Idris 2](https://idris-lang.org/) is a purely functional programming language
with first class types.

For installation instructions, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

The [wiki](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/wiki) lists a number of useful
resources, in particular

+ [What's changed since Idris 1](https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/updates/updates.html)
+ [Resources for learning Idris](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/wiki/Resources),
  including [official talks](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/wiki/Resources#official-talks)
  that showcase its capabilities

## Installation and Packages

The most common way to install the latest version of Idris and its packages is through [`pack`][PACK] Idris' package manager. Working with the latest version of Idris is as easy as `pack switch latest`.
Follow instructions [on the `pack` repository][PACK] for how to install `pack`.

To use `pack` and idris, you will need an `.ipkg` file (Idris-package file) that describes your idris project.
You can generate one with `idris2 --init`. Once setup with an `.ipkg` file, `pack` gives you access to the [_pack collection_][PACK_COL] of packages, a set of compatible libraries in the ecosystem.
If your dependency is in the `depends` field of your `.ipkg` file, `pack` will automatically pull the dependency from you matching pack collection.
The wiki hosts a list of [curated packages by the community](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/wiki/Third-party-Libraries).

Finally, `pack` also makes it easy to download, and keep updated version of, [idris2-lsp](https://github.com/idris-community/idris2-lsp), and other idris-related programs.


## Things still missing

+ Cumulativity (currently `Type : Type`. Bear that in mind when you think
  you've proved something)
+ `rewrite` doesn't yet work on dependent types

one way to do so. The [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) outline
the process. Having read that, choose a [good first issue][1] or have a look at
the [contributions wanted][2] for something more involved. This [map][3] should
help you find your way around the source code. See [the wiki page][4]
